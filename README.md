This is a read-me file describing the contents of user5858x/Programming Assignment3

The file run_analysis.R contains a script that reads in data from the UCI HAR dataset (found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and merges the testing and training observations into one dataset. It writes out two csv files - one containing all summary statistics for mean and standard deviation (tidy_data_mean_std.csv), and another containing only mean summary statistics (tidy_data_mean_only.csv).

There is ample documentation within run_analysis.R to explain the steps taken within the file.
